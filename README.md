# WinterTerm2024-NLPModel
***
This repo is for the implementation of an already built NLP Model. We want to train a model that will take in a coherent passage and return the subject of the passage and its average connotation (a number bounded between -1 and 1).  We plan to achieve this through topic identification and sentiment classification. This collaborative project will also serve as an introduction to a wide variety of ML and NLP topics.
