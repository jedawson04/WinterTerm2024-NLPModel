# WinterTerm2024-NLPModel
This repo is for the implementation of an already built NLP Model. We want to implement an algorithm that will be able to take as an input any coherent passage and return the subject of the passage and its average connotation (a number bounded between -1 and 1).  This collaborative project will serve as an intro to ML and NLP Models.
